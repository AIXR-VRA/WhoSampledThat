## 🎵 Adding New Tracks

To add new tracks to the game, edit `src/data/tracklist.json`:

```json
{
  "originalSample": {
    "artist": "Original Artist Name",
    "trackName": "Original Track Name",
    "youtubeVideoId": "YouTube_Video_ID",
    "startTime": 30,
    "duration": 15
  },
  "newSong": {
    "artist": "Sampling Artist Name", 
    "trackName": "New Track Name",
    "youtubeVideoId": "YouTube_Video_ID",
    "startTime": 45,
    "duration": 20
  }
}
```

### Track Configuration
- **`youtubeVideoId`**: Extract from YouTube URL (e.g., `dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
- **`startTime`**: When to start playback (seconds)
- **`duration`**: How long to play (seconds) - optional

## 🖼️ Dynamic Share Image Generation

The game features a sophisticated Open Graph (OG) image generation system that creates custom share images for social media platforms when players share their scores.

### How It Works

#### 1. Share URL Generation
When players share their scores, the game generates a unique share URL in the format:
```
https://whosampledthat.com/share/{shareId}
```

The `shareId` is a URL-safe base64 encoded string containing player scores in a compact format:
```
Format: "name1:score1,name2:score2,name3:score3"
Example: "Alice:15,Bob:12,Charlie:8" → encoded → "QWxpY2U6MTUsQm9iOjEyLENoYXJsaWU6OA"
```

#### 2. Dynamic Meta Tag Injection
When a share URL is accessed:
- The Cloudflare Worker intercepts the request
- Decodes the share ID to extract player scores
- Dynamically generates Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Injects custom meta tags with player-specific content into the HTML

#### 3. Custom Image Generation
The system generates unique OG images at `/api/share-image/{shareId}`:
- **Base Image**: Uses `social-share-card-base-square.png` (1080x1080px)
- **Dynamic Overlay**: Top 3 players with scores overlaid using `workers-og` library
- **Format**: Square format (1080x1080) for optimal social media compatibility
- **Caching**: Generated images are cached for 1 hour to improve performance

#### 4. Technical Implementation

**Share ID Encoding/Decoding:**
```javascript
// Encode scores to share ID
const scoreString = players.map(p => `${p.name}:${p.score}`).join(',');
const shareId = btoa(scoreString).replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_');

// Decode share ID back to scores
const decoded = atob(shareId.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/'));
```

**Dynamic Meta Tags:**
```html
<!-- Generated for each share -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Who Sampled That? - Game Results! 🎵">
<meta property="og:description" content="🥇 Alice: 15 pts | 🥈 Bob: 12 pts | 🥉 Charlie: 8 pts">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://whosampledthat.com/api/share-image/{shareId}">
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1080">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="1080">
```

**Image Generation Process:**
1. **Base Image Loading**: Fetches the square base image from assets
2. **JSX Component Creation**: Builds a React-like component with scores overlay
3. **Image Rendering**: Uses `workers-og` to render the component as PNG
4. **Error Handling**: Falls back to base image if generation fails

#### 5. Performance & Reliability Features

- **Caching Strategy**: Generated images cached for 1 hour, share pages for 5 minutes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks to original homepage if share ID is invalid
- **Format Optimization**: Square images work best across all social platforms
- **Compression**: Efficient base64 encoding keeps share URLs short

### Social Media Integration

The generated images work seamlessly with:
- **Facebook**: Displays custom image with player scores
- **Twitter**: Rich media cards with game results
- **Discord**: Embedded previews with leaderboard
- **LinkedIn**: Professional sharing with results
- **WhatsApp**: Preview images in chat

### File Structure for OG Generation

```
PersonalApps/
├── src/worker.js              # Main worker with OG generation logic
├── public/
│   └── social-share-card-base-square.png  # Base image template
└── wrangler.toml             # Cloudflare Workers configuration
```

This system enables rich social sharing experiences, allowing players to showcase their music knowledge with visually appealing, automatically generated scoreboard images.
