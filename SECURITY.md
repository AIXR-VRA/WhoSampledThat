# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Overview

This project takes security seriously and implements multiple layers of protection for both the live production environment and contributor safety.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** open a public issue. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to [your-email@domain.com] 
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within **48 hours** and work with you to resolve the issue.

## 🛡️ Security Measures in Place

### Production Deployment Security
- ✅ **Fork Protection**: Only the original repository can deploy to production
- ✅ **Secret Isolation**: GitHub secrets are not accessible to forks
- ✅ **Repository Validation**: `github.repository` check prevents unauthorized deployments
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Test jobs run for all, deploy jobs only for maintainers

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ **Share ID Validation**: Strict format validation prevents path traversal
- ✅ **HTML Escaping**: Player names are sanitized before HTML injection
- ✅ **Length Limits**: Input size restrictions prevent DoS attacks
- ✅ **Character Validation**: Only safe base64url characters allowed

### Dependency Security
- ✅ **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential packages included
- ✅ **Version Pinning**: Dependencies locked to specific versions
- ✅ **Regular Updates**: Dependencies monitored for security updates

## 🔧 Security Guidelines for Contributors

### Safe Development Practices
1. **Never commit secrets** - Use `.env.example` for environment variable templates
2. **Validate user input** - Always sanitize data from external sources
3. **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent injection attacks
4. **Limit API exposure** - Minimize attack surface area

### Testing Security Changes
1. **Test with malicious input** - Try path traversal, XSS payloads
2. **Verify error handling** - Ensure graceful failure modes
3. **Check logs** - No sensitive data should be logged
4. **Validate rate limits** - Prevent abuse scenarios

## 📋 Security Checklist for PRs

Before submitting security-related changes:

- [ ] Input validation added for any new user inputs
- [ ] Output sanitization implemented for dynamic content
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and secure
- [ ] Changes tested with malicious input
- [ ] Documentation updated if security model changes

## 🔄 Security Update Process

### For Minor Issues
1. Create private fork/branch
2. Implement fix with tests
3. Code review by maintainer
4. Deploy to production
5. Notify community (if appropriate)

### For Critical Issues
1. **Immediate response** within 24 hours
2. **Hotfix deployment** if needed
3. **Security advisory** published
4. **Credit to reporter** (with permission)

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Open Source Nature**: All code is public (by design)
- **Client-Side Logic**: Game logic runs in browser
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: YouTube API integration

### Acceptable Risks
- **Game Cheating**: Not a security threat (it's a party game!)
- **Score Manipulation**: Client-side only, no persistence
- **Track Data**: Public YouTube content only

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **ESLint Security Rules**: Static code analysis
- **GitHub Actions**: Build-time security validation

### Manual Reviews
- **Code Reviews**: All PRs reviewed for security implications
- **Dependency Audits**: Regular review of package dependencies
- **Access Reviews**: Periodic review of repository permissions
